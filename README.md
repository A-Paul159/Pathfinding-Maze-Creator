# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive React-based application that visualizes **pathfinding algorithms** step by step on a grid.  
This project demonstrates how algorithms like **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A\*** explore nodes to find the shortest path in a maze.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Interactive grid** – set walls, move start and end nodes  
- 🔄 **Multiple algorithms** – visualize BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A\*  
- 🏗️ **Maze generation** – random obstacle creation  
- ⚡ **Animation controls** – adjust speed of visualization  
- 🔙 **Undo/Redo** functionality for walls and paths  
- 🎭 **Customizable themes** – change board colors and style

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (UI + state management)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **HTML5 / CSS3**  
- **Bootstrap / FontAwesome** (for styling and icons)
